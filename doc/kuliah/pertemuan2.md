Background.

Tissue manipulation is a dangerous one of which is the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol within the TCP / IP protocol that is responsible for IP address resolution into a Media Access Control address (MAC address). ARP poisoning is a technique to attack the local computer network using either wired or wireless, which allows attackers bias can know the data frames on a local network or making modifications in advance or even stop the traffic. The principle of this ARP poisoning attacks exploit weaknesses in computer network itself, which uses ARP broadcast.

Understanding ARP Poisoning
What is it ARP poisoning? ARP poisoning is one way to attack a local computer network either through a wired or wireless media router, which allows an attacker can determine the data frames on a local network or make modifications to the traffic or even stop the network traffic. Basically this ARP poisoning attacks exploit weaknesses in computer network itself, which uses ARP broadcast.

How it Works ARP Poisoning

Basically, the working principle of ARP spoofing / poisoning is a fake ARP sends data to the ethernet LAN. The goal is not to associate the MAC address with the IP address of the other node. Traffic data is any means that the IP address can send the data does not match the destination but rather to the attacker. The attacker can then choose to forward to the address that was intended sender or modify the data before it is forwarded. Attackers can also launch a denial of service attack to the victim by associating the MAC address that does not exist to the victim's IP address getaway. On ARP Poisoning there are some programs that are used to manipulate tissue. The program is one of them is scapy. What it scapy?

scapy
Scapy is a program created using python programming language and a very "powerful" in interaction to manipulate the packets across the network. Scapy able to "build" and break up packets of different types of existing protocols, the transmission-download it, catch it, accept the request and answer, and lots more. Scapy can be used to handle a wide range of activities related to the network, such as the "scanning", "tracerouting", "attack" or "network discovery". Scapy can even teach us all processes of a protocol.

Conclusion.

From some of the things that have been submitted before we can conclude, that the data traffic that occurs between the network A to Machine B must go through the Router that connects the two machines. If one wants to send data packets it must do an ARP request and reply from the destination machine will proceed through the Router. Router who reply to the sender to perform ARP reply.
