Security is very important for the ongoing authorization to the network because it is not uncommon others will get into your network or computer network when it is connected to another computer or the Internet, hence the need for a protocol or algorithm that is able to withstand such attacks on writing times I share some of the architecture in use in computer networks.

Architecture In Computer Networking.

1. OSI Layer.

OSI Layer is a network architectural model developed by the Agency for International Organization of Standardization (ISO) in Europe in 1977. OSI (Open Systems Interconnection.) OSI 7 layer possessed. OSI Layer say this in pretty good because enough plated layer so difficult for others to enter into this architecture, unfortunately, these systems are ideal to be applied so that only in use for learning only.

Layer OSI layer is divided into seven sections and each section or layer has different functions - different.

1. Physical Layer - is the layer in the form of physic or closer to the hardware functions for synchronizing bits, network architectures (Ethernet or Token Ring), cabling, Network Interface Card (NIC) and Other - Other.

2. Data-Link Layer - Data Link Layer befungsi section for determining the data bits are grouped into order and into the frame. at this level of filtration error occurs, hardware addressing such examples Media Access Control address (MAC address).

3. Network Layer - OSI Model section serves for IP addressing, make the header for the packets, and perform routing through internetworking routers and switches using the layer-3.

4. Transport Layer - Serves to break data into packets of data and provide the serial number of all packets so that they can in order back at the point of destination, after it is received. In addition, this layer can also make a sign that the packet is received successfully (acknowledgment), and resend the missing packets currently in the middle of the road.

5. Session Layer- Serves to define when connections can be created, maintained, or destroyed. In addition, this layer also carried the name resolution.

6. Presentation Layer- to translate data to be sent by the application into a format that can be sent over the network. Protocols that are in this level is a software redirektor (redirector software).

7. Application Layer - Serves as the application interface and functionality of the network, set up so that applications can access the network, and then create error messages. The protocols in this layer are HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and NFS





2. TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol).

TCP / IP Layer - architecturally similar to OSI jarigan but TCP / IP only has 4 Layer on the architectural making it more vulnerable to attack but this architectural be realized so much now that using this architectural.



TCP / IP is composed of four layers (layer), in the form of a set of protocols that storied. The layers are:






Network Access Layer, Responsible for sending and receiving data from physical media. This layer serves to transmit and receive to and from the physical media is the lowest layer of the TCP / IP model system provides a means for sending data.
Internet Layer, Responsible for the delivery process to the appropriate address (IP, ARP, and ICMP). This layer serves to find the best path for delivery of data packets.
to bundle the data and provide the address of the packet pass data between the network access layer and host-to-host transport layer datagram routing to remote hosts.
Transport Layer, is responsible in communication between hosts. This layer is responsible for opening up communication between two computers and sends the packet, protocol which plays a role in this layer are:
TCP (Transport Control Protocol).
UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
Application Layer, Points of applications that use the TCP / IP stack is functioning berada.Layer provide service to users of the network. Here is an example:
- Telnet: Provides services such as remote / access the computer remotely.
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Provides services such as downloading and uploading files.
- HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol): an application layer network protocol yamng
used for distributed information systems, collaborative, and using hypermedia.
- SNMP (Single Network Management Protocol): Protocol that is used to control
and monitor network devices, SNMP is also used for configuration management,
manage performance, and security systems.



conclusion:

From the description of the architecture above can be concluded that:

- Architecture OSI Layer Architecture safer than the TCP / IP architecture unfortunately this
it is ideal that can not be realized, and only used for learning.

- TCP / IP is a lot, realized with weaknesses in terms of security but many
development will be undertaken to this protocol to be secure in the network.

- In terms of Layer was very noticeable difference that the layer of the OSI more than
TCP / IP and it was already clear what separates the safe side security is the OSI and TCP / IP.
