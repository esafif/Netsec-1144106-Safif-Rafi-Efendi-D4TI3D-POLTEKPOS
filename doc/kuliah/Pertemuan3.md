Background.
"No System Is Safe" That writing is a lot written in a lot of social media, especially on network system which has high security but still can be mapped by hackers, of course they have a lot of anatomy and how to perform the hack to a particular site, the question of how the anatomy of hacking it? okay with it.

ISI
Anatomy hacking is a step - a step or common ways used by hackers to hack a site or a particular system, at this meeting I will explain the anatomy of hacking in general like the one below

1. Reconnaissance.
Is a method that is used to meyelidiki system that runs either passively or actively, if doing penyeidikan passively then hackers simply observing system passively and follow the existing system, and if the investigation is active then the hacker will do sniffer or more observe protocol that skipped and packages - packages that exist in it.

2. Scanning.
Is a way to do a scanner to open ports in this way can usually use scapy or using a port scanner with a python file by using the documentation on pythonforbeginners.com.

3. Gaining Access.
Collect more data such as retrieving the username and password and gain access to the general user in a system so peetas bias entered into the system by using the ID or the user of the victim

4. Maintaining Access.
Is such a way that once hackers gain access to computer victims and want to retain the system is usually a hacker will try to maintain its power in various ways, such as planting a backdoor, Trojan, rootkits, etc., sometimes even a hacker also rectify weaknesses that exist (patch) that the computer not attacked another hacker.

5. Covering Track.
Is a way to remove traces of forensic or log into the system that has been mapped out, and hide ip address of computer hackers themselves.


Conclusion.
many of the anatomy for hacking but the general picture as exposed above that perform the steps - steps ranging from port scanning probe system go to the victim's account and mastering system then removes all traces of
