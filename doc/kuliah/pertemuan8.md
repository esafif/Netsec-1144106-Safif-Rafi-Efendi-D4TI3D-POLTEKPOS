At previous meetings we have discussed about Firewall. What is the firewall, what it does, how it works and the functionality of the firewall itself. At this meeting we will discuss the Intrusion Detection System, or better known as IDS. Before entering in the material IDS let the review of the firewall itself first.

A firewall is a system or device that allows network traffic that is considered safe for traffic through it and prevent an unsecured network. Generally, a firewall is implemented in a dedicated machine, which runs on the gate (gateway) between the local network and other networks. Firewalls are also commonly used to control access to anyone who has access to a private network from outside parties. Today, the term firewall becomes a generic term that refers to a system that manages the communication between two different networks.
