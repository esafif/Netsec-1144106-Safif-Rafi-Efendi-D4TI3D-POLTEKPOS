At previous meetings we have discussed about Firewall. What is the firewall, what it does, how it works and the functionality of the firewall itself. At this meeting we will discuss the Intrusion Detection System, or better known as IDS. Before entering in the material IDS let the review of the firewall itself first.

A firewall is a system or device that allows network traffic that is considered safe for traffic through it and prevent an unsecured network. Generally, a firewall is implemented in a dedicated machine, which runs on the gate (gateway) between the local network and other networks. Firewalls are also commonly used to control access to anyone who has access to a private network from outside parties. Today, the term firewall becomes a generic term that refers to a system that manages the communication between two different networks.

DEFINITION IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a system of monitoring the network traffic and monitoring of suspicious activities in a network system. If it is found that the activities mencurigakanberhubungan with trafficjaringan then IDS will alert the system or network administrator.

In many cases IDS also respond to traffic that is not normal / anomaly by blocking the action of a user or IP address (Internet Protocol) network accessing sources of business. IDS itself appeared with several types and a different approach that essentially serves to detect suspicious traffic within a network. Some types of IDS are: network-based (NIDS) and host-based (HIDS). There IDS works by detecting the search based on the specific characteristics of the trials are often performed. This method is similar to how the antivirus software to detect and protect the system against threats.

Then there is also the IDS that works by detecting based on a comparison of normal traffic patterns that exist and then look for abnormalities of existing traffic. There IDS function only as a supervisor and warning when the attack occurred and there are IDS that works not only as a supervisor and a warner, but also can perform an activity which responds to the attempted attack against the network and computer systems.
